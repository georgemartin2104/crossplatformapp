Cross platform mobile app made using react native and expo

Made during my final year of university and my first attempt at mobile development and my first experience using javascript.

Uses majoritively percentage based values so that it will work on various screen sizes.

Using expo and react native the app will run on Android and iOS

A brief video demonstration can be found at the following link: https://youtu.be/tP8fNzSfgI4
